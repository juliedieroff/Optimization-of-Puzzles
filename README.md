For my undergraduate project at the University of Edinburgh we used mathematical optimization techniques to solve puzzles. The code in this repo is my independent contributions to the implementation of this project. The following is the abstract of our paper:

This report explores mathematical optimization techniques applied to the realm of deductive puzzles. These puzzles have the distinct challenge of spatial considerations in combination with logical rules. We predominantly focus on the branch of optimization that involves Integer Programming. By applying these methods to smaller scale puzzles we demonstrate how classical optimization techniques can be implemented in unconventional fields. We explore new developments in Bilevel Programming incorporated into a famous puzzle. We present several models for each puzzle and assess their comparative performance. We propose that taking a deliberate and calculated approach to a problem allows us to address particular logical constraints without the need for extra computation. From this we assert the importance of dealing with precise conditions carefully in Integer Programming formulations.
